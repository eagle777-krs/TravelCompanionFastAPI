# TravelCompanionFastAPI
An advanced travel planning app with Telegram bot lets users enter flights to get personalized hotel and place recommendations. It asynchronously queries APIs (Google Places, Foursquare, Booking.com), caches results via Memcached, filters by type, rating, price, location, tracks user history and reviews, and stores everything in MySQL.
